## To-do:        

1.	Set Up with ARM Template: Create an Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template to streamline the setup of your WebApp.
•	Tip: ARM templates are great for automating infrastructure deployments on Azure. Familiarize yourself with their syntax and structure for efficient setup. 

2.	Develop Your WebAPI: Use asp.net to craft your web API. Make sure to include an OpenAPI specification which will offer clear documentation for users.
•	Tip: OpenAPI specs are essential for clear communication and setting expectations with the users of your API. Tools like Swagger can help generate and visualize these specifications.

3.	Stay Updated on Libraries: Ensure you have a mechanism to be alerted when new libraries are available.
•	Tip: This could mean subscribing to newsletters or notifications from package repositories or library sources related to your project.

4.	Deploy on Azure: Make your API live by deploying it on an Azure website. 
•	Tip: Azure offers various deployment tools and CI/CD integrations. Consider automating your deployment process to simplify updates and changes.

5.	Test Your API: Investigate if there are suitable tools for testing your API.
•	Tip: Postman and Insomnia are popular tools for API testing. They allow you to make requests, organize endpoints, and even automate tests.

6.	Maintain Multiple Environments: Organize your workflow by having separate environments like development, staging, and production.
•	Tip: Keeping environments separate allows safe testing and development without affecting live users. Deploy changes to staging first, test thoroughly, and then move to production.

7.	Use Rapid API: Once your API is stable in production, publish it through a Rapid API account.
•	Tip: Rapid API is a platform that can help in monetizing and sharing your API with a broader audience. Ensure your API documentation is clear before publishing.

8.	✔️ Secure a Custom Domain: Acquire a custom domain with the appropriate SSL certificates. Your target domain is https://glizzyglobal.net 
•	Tip: SSL certificates not only secure the data transfer but also instill trust among your API users. Use Azure's App Service to manage domains and SSL with ease.

## Notes:
Build/Test and publish WebAPI that consumes Library Team Nuget Package ? Monetize?? rapid api?
